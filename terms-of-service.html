        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: March 31, 2025</strong></p>
        
        <p>Welcome to Finland-Pi (FI Pi), a decentralized application operating on the Pi Network Testnet. By accessing or using Finland-Pi, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the app. These Terms should be read in conjunction with our Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using Finland-Pi, you agree to comply with these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and any applicable laws or regulations. We may update these Terms from time to time, and your continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of those changes. We will notify you of significant updates via the app or email.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>To use Finland-Pi, you must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be at least 13 years old. Users under 13 are not permitted to use the app, in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</li>
            <li>Have completed or be in the process of completing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification on the Pi Network app, as required for full access to Finland-Pi.</li>
            <li>Not be located in a jurisdiction where the use of Finland-Pi or the Pi Network is prohibited by law.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Account Registration and Access</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>KYC-Verified Accounts</strong>: To access full functionality, you must complete KYC verification on the Pi Network app and provide proof of completion (e.g., a redacted screenshot showing “KYC passed” status). Upon verification, you can register an account with a username, email address, and password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account credentials.</li>
            <li><strong>Guest Accounts</strong>: If you have not completed KYC, you may use a guest account with limited functionality. Guest accounts are assigned temporary passwords, which expire after seven (7) days. After expiration, you must create a new guest account or complete KYC verification to continue using the app.</li>
            <li>You agree to provide accurate and truthful information during registration and KYC verification. Providing false information may result in account suspension or termination.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Use of the App</h2>
        <p>Finland-Pi allows users to interact with the Pi Network Testnet, manage accounts, and access features based on their KYC status. You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the app only for lawful purposes and in compliance with these Terms.</li>
            <li>Not engage in activities that may harm the app or its users, such as spamming, creating excessive guest accounts, or attempting to bypass KYC requirements.</li>
            <li>Not attempt to reverse-engineer, hack, or interfere with the app’s functionality, including its password management system or KYC verification process.</li>
            <li>Notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access to your account.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Password Management</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>KYC-Verified Users</strong>: If you forget your password, you may use our password recovery feature, which is tied to your verified Pi Network identity. We strongly recommend storing your password in a trusted, external password manager for added security.</li>
            <li><strong>Guest Accounts</strong>: Temporary passwords for guest accounts are valid for seven (7) days to prevent spam and abuse. After this period, the password expires, and you must create a new guest account or complete KYC verification.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for any activity conducted through your account, whether by you or someone else using your credentials.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. KYC Verification</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Full access to Finland-Pi requires KYC verification completed on the Pi Network app. You must submit proof of KYC completion (e.g., a redacted screenshot showing “KYC passed” status) for review.</li>
            <li>We may manually or automatically verify your KYC status. Delays in access may occur if your Pi Network KYC approval is pending, which can take from minutes to months.</li>
            <li>Failure to complete KYC verification will limit your access to guest account functionality only.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>All content, logos, designs, and technology in Finland-Pi are the property of Finland-Pi or its licensors. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works of any part of the app without prior written permission.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Finland-Pi is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the app will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.</li>
            <li>We are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the app, including but not limited to financial losses, data loss, or delays in KYC verification.</li>
            <li>You acknowledge that the Pi Network Testnet is experimental, and using Finland-Pi may involve risks, including potential loss of data or tokens.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We may suspend or terminate your access to Finland-Pi at our discretion, with or without notice, if you violate these Terms, engage in fraudulent activity, or for any other reason.</li>
            <li>You may terminate your account at any time by contacting us at [FinlandPi.FPi@gmail.com]. Upon termination, your account data will be deleted in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>10. Governing Law and Arbitration</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Finland. Any disputes arising from these Terms will be resolved through binding arbitration under Finnish law. The arbitration will be conducted in Finland by a neutral arbitrator agreed upon by both parties. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. You agree to waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.</p>
        
        <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or app functionality. Updates will be posted here with a revised “Last Updated” date. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically.</p>
