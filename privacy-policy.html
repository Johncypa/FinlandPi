    <h1>Finland-Pi (FI Pi) Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: March 31, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to FinlandPi! We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use our platform, including details about our password management system and Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process. By accessing or using FinlandPi, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information</strong>: Username, email address, and password (for registered users).</li>
        <li><strong>KYC Verification Data</strong>: Proof of KYC completion from the Pi Network app (e.g., redacted screenshots showing KYC status), including your Pi Network username or unique identifier. We do not store sensitive personal data such as ID photos or full names unless required for verification.</li>
        <li><strong>Guest Account Data</strong>: Temporary passwords and basic usage data for guest accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Information about how you interact with FinlandPi (e.g., login times, features used), collected to improve our services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To verify your identity and ensure compliance with our KYC requirements, which must originally be completed on the Pi Network app.</li>
        <li>To provide and manage your account, including password recovery and reset options.</li>
        <li>To prevent spam and maintain platform integrity, especially for guest accounts.</li>
        <li>To enhance and personalize your experience on FinlandPi.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations and protect against fraud or misuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Password Management Policy</h2>
    <p>FinlandPi implements a secure password management system to support users and prevent abuse:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For KYC-Verified Users</strong>: Users who have completed KYC verification on the Pi Network app and registered on FinlandPi can access a password recovery feature. If you forget your password, you can reset it using a secure process tied to your verified Pi Network identity. We recommend storing your password in a trusted, external password manager for added security. KYC verification is confirmed via user-submitted proof (e.g., a redacted screenshot of your Pi app KYC status).</li>
        <li><strong>For Guest Accounts</strong>: Guest accounts are assigned temporary passwords, which are securely stored for seven (7) days to prevent spam and the creation of excessive random accounts. After this period, the password expires, and a new account must be created. Full functionality may be limited until KYC verification is completed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. KYC Verification Process</h2>
    <p>To ensure a secure and fair ecosystem, FinlandPi requires KYC verification for full access. This must be originally completed on the Pi Network app. Our verification process includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users submitting proof of KYC completion (e.g., a redacted screenshot from the Pi Network app or Pi Browser showing a “KYC passed” status).</li>
        <li>Manual or automated review of submitted proof to confirm validity. We do not retain KYC data beyond the verification process unless required by law.</li>
        <li>Delays in full access may occur if Pi Network’s KYC approval is pending (which can take from minutes to months).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard encryption and security measures to protect your information, including passwords and KYC verification data. However, no online system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection against all risks. We will notify you in case of a data breach affecting your information, as required by law.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>KYC verification data is retained only for the duration needed to confirm your identity and is deleted thereafter, unless legal requirements dictate otherwise.</li>
        <li>Guest account passwords are stored for seven (7) days and then deleted.</li>
        <li>Account information and usage data are retained as long as your account is active or as required by law, with an option to request deletion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR in the EU), you may have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access, correct, or delete your personal data.</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict certain data processing.</li>
        <li>Request data portability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at FinlandPi.FPi@gmail.com.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>FinlandPi does not share your data with third parties except as necessary to verify KYC status with Pi Network (if an official partnership is established) or to comply with legal obligations. We do not sell your data.</p>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>FinlandPi is not intended for users under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn that we have, we will delete it promptly.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Updates will be posted here with a revised “Last Updated” date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. We may introduce changes and innovations to this policy in the future as needed.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at: FinlandPi.FPi@gmail.com</p>

    <h2>Notes and Customization</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal Review</strong>: This is a general draft. Consult a legal professional to ensure compliance with Finnish/EU laws (e.g., GDPR) or other applicable regulations.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Details</strong>: If you implement an API or automated KYC check later, update Section 4 accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Language</strong>: The policy is in English as per your input. Let me know if you’d prefer it in Finnish or another language.</li>
